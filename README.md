# I3E_ASSG1
Repository for my Interactive 3D Experience module Assignment 1

# Controls:
WASD to move
Shift to sprint
Spacebar to jump
E to interact
Mouse to control camera

# Goal of the game:
Pass through stages and collect all 9 collectibles to beat the game.

# Platform: 
PC Windows
Low end computers should be able to run the game without issue.

# Known bugs:
In the room where you are required to push boxes to jump on and get over the wall, you're able to open the one-way door by going up close, jumping, and spamming the interact button.


# Answer key:

Starting room
Grab the black key on the table to open the door.

First room
Hop on the objects starting from the right side of the room in order to traverse across the room without falling into the water. Once you're on the pipe on the left side of the room, jump onto the vent on the wall, before jumping onto the pipe and moving on to the next room. 

Second room
Walk on the pipe until you reach the end, then jump down onto the rock with the ‘job application’ and collect it. Afterwards jump on the vents on the wall until you reach the rocks and jump on them. Make your way across the rocks and jump on the skeleton in the water before jumping onto the vent and reaching the next door.

Third room
Upon entering the room you will see a cannon as well as a massive wall blocking your way. In order to break down the wall you'll need to fire the cannon, but to do so you must first acquire a cannonball. Head into the room on the left and move the boxes to the opening in the wall. Afterwards step on the box and jump over the wall. Now, avoid the lazers in the obstacle course and collect the cannonball. Use the vents on the walls to jump up to the top. Grab the blue key in sight and drop down where you'll be able to open the door and make your way out. Afterwards, interact with the cannon and make your way down to the central room.

Fourth room
Upon reaching the central room you'll be able to open the door on the right which leads to the fourth room. You will need to acquire a ‘magic ring’ which will allow you to enter the toxic waste unscathed. This ring is located on top of the pipes, which you can get to by traversing obstacles on the left side of the room. Once you have the ring, jump into the toxic waste and break rocks until you find the one containing a ‘crystal’. (The right rock will have a glow from underneath it) Once you've obtained it, move to the opening where you'll be able to jump on vents to get out. Under the table near the door on the right side of the room, you'll find a yellow key which you can use to access the next room. Now return back to the central room.

Fifth room
Enter the fifth room using the key you found. Simply traverse the obstacles and avoid the lazers to reach the far end of the room, where you will be able to collect the sculpture, afterwards, drop down and make your way back to the central room. 

Central room
Interact with the roundtable to place all the collectibles down. Once you've done that, you can interact with it again to summon the ‘painting’ which is the final collectible that you need to collect. Once you've collected that item, you will beat the game.
